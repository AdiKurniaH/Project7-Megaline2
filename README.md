# Megaline 2 Project
Megaline mobile operator is dissatisfied because most of their customers are still using old packages. The company wants to develop a model that can analyze consumer behavior and recommend one of Megaline's two newest packages: Smart or Ultra. The data that can be accessed is data for the behavior of customers who have switched to the latest package (from the previous Megaline 1 project). 

## Objective
Develop a model that is able to select packages appropriately.  The model must have the highest level of accuracy, the threshold for the level of accuracy is 0.75 and also check the level of accuracy of the model using the test dataset.
